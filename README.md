Channel Project, 2019

Willie Eaton

For CodeLouisville

This is a CSS, HTML, and JS project for my front-end web development course.
It is intended to serve as a rough draft for a landing page for a friend's
YouTube media-review channel.

CSS features: 
* Responsivity: Navbar changes from horiz to dropdown on mobile
* Minimalist, modern design.  Sans serif font family; possibly all-lowercase
text formatting (haven't decided on that yet; may make selectable)
* Google Fonts integration for cross-browser display of a Helvetica-like font (Currently using Lato and/or Open Sans; open to change) 

JS features:
* Dropdown menu for mobile devices
* CSS selection in footer - include a joke style in addition to two actual
good ones

Content:
* Main pages: "About" "Cast" "Shows" "Contact"
* About page: Brief summary of the content of the channel; enticing logos
and/or screen caps from shows if available
* Cast page: Landing page for all cast members; on desktop use JS to display
a profile for each performer (photograph, name, shows, bio); on mobile give
each individual an HTML page with the same content
* Show page: Works similarly to cast page, but details the programming instead of the personalities
* Contact page: mailto form; email addresses for webmaster, general, and
individual cast members (if available and wanted)
